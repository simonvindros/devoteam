### Devoteam technical assignment Frontend Developer

Devoteam's technical assignment provides you with a public API (https://randomuser.me/api/), a Figma Design and a lists of features to be implemented:

A switch between grid and list view.
Sort the names (ascending and descending) functionality.
A search bar.

They also want you to handle error and empty states and of course implement a Responsive Design. They also wish for a unit test of some major functionality.

I've finished the task and implemented all of the functional requirements. Also the UI is responsive and works on pretty much all resolutions.

I decided to implement a test of the Apps major function: rendering out the information when a API call is succesful.

Pagination was also implemented and I've designed it as it was to be handed over to a colleague.

I also took the liberty to host it at https://vindros-devoteam.surge.sh/
